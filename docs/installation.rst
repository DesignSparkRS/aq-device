Installation
------------

A pre-configured Micro SD card image is provided and presently the supported method of installation.

The latest image is dated: :code:`1st December 2022`

Start by downloading the image:

https://downloads.designspark.io/projects/aq-device/images/aq-pi-011222.zip

Following which this should be uncompressed and written out to a Micro SD card that is at least 8GB in size. 

.. tip::

   This is just the same as when writing out a regular Raspbian OS image. 
   Those running Linux or Mac OS and familiar with the command line can use :code:`dd`, whereas
   `balenaEtcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_ is a popular GUI option that is available for Windows, 
   Linux and Mac.

.. warning:: 

   If you are upgrading from an earlier image, don't forget to make a copy of your configuration file and to copy any logged data from the Micro SD card.
